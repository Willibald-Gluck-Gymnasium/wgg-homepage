Are you in grade 7? Are you a good reader? Yes? Then take part in the English Reading Competition in April!

Step 1: Win the reading challenge in your own class.

Step 2: Come to the school challenge and compete with the other class champions.

Step 3: Take home a diploma, an English book prize and gain RESPECT!

Sounds good? Ask your English teacher or Mrs Wimmer and Mrs Jauernig.

Please note: Due to Corona, the English Reading Competition had to be cancelled last year, but we are hoping to read again in 2021.
